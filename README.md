# python-challenge

Hello!

Inside the python-challenge folder you will find a folder for PyBank and PyPoll. Inside these folders you will find an analysis and resource folder. In the resources folder you will find the csv file. In the analysis you will find an empty txt file. That txt file does not contain my analysis results. My analysis results are located after you enter either the PyBank or PyPoll folders along with the python file with the code for each

I hope this was able to provide you with some guidance as to where everything is located.
